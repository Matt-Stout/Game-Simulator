# Game-Simulator
A CS 367 group program that simulates a game and keeps score, Spring 2017

In a group of six total students, we created a game simulator that utilizes iterators and ADTs. Some of the base classes were provided by instructors; the rest of the code we had to collaborate with our group members and build the code together.
